; This is a kitchen sink demo of
; what HTTP can do when
; connected to a real server
; for making GET and POST
; requests.
;
; This is hitting a live server
; at data.remysharp.com -
; this is a free service that
; I'm running that you can
; use if you don't have the
; ability to run your own
; server.
;
; Enjoy,
